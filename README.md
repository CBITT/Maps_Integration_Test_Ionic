# Maps_Integration_Test_Ionic

Experimenting with the integration of Google Maps API on the Ionic platform. The application uses a web API (essentially a list of locations) which gets presented on the mobile phone. For testing purposes I have created this file and hosted it as json online. Link [here](http://myjson.com/4685b).

## Installing

Take the name after `ionic-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation

``` 
Then, to run it, cd into the project's directory and run. 

```bash
$ ionic serve
```
